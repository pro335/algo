Watch out for xss

1. Have a subdomain that runs the javascript. 
These are the oldest known way to prevent against JS threats. Same origin policy - if you are running on s.io.com you cant access io.com.
set an http only on session cookie. Set http_only to true. 

2. Must stop unwanted AJAX request, would need session cookie to do so. 

3. CSRF token

4. Execute in iframe.
